Most of my repositories are modules for, or applications in, [go](https://golang.org).

### What's exciting

- [welk](./welk) is a CLI tool that manages applications you usually install with `curl | sh`.
- [whatsnew](./whatsnew) lets your application notify users when there are new releases.
- [future](./future) is an exploration of futures with go1.18+ type parameters.

### Go errors
Many of my repositories deal with `error` values:

- Use interfaces to express behaviours with [vice](./vice) 
- Explicit error wrapping (instead of `%w` with cling [cling](./cling)
- Consume Go2/xerrors error frames programaticaly with [framerr](./framerr)
- Create concrete errors with [spalling](./spalling)

### Old stuff

All my old repositories are in my [crawl space](https://github.com/crawl-space)
