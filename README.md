Most of my repositories are modules for, or applications in, [go](https://golang.org).

### What's exciting

- [welk](https://github.com/jbowes/welk) is a CLI tool that manages applications you usually install with `curl | sh`.
- [whatsnew](https://github.com/jbowes/whatsnew) lets your application notify users when there are new releases.
- [semver](https://github.com/jbowes/semver) is a Semantic Versioning parser that's 10x faster than the most popular package.
- [future](https://github.com/jbowes/future) is an exploration of futures with go1.18+ type parameters.

### Go errors
Many of my repositories deal with `error` values:

- Use interfaces to express behaviours with [vice](https://github.com/jbowes/vice) 
- Explicit error wrapping (instead of `%w` with cling [cling](https://github.com/jbowes/cling)
- Consume Go2/xerrors error frames programaticaly with [framerr](https://github.com/jbowes/framerr)
- Create concrete errors with [spalling](https://github.com/jbowes/spalling)

### Old stuff

All my old repositories are in my [crawl space](https://github.com/crawl-space)
